Hurricane ETL and Visualization Project

Authors: Deepika Pitchikala, Leif Munroe, Dhawanpreet Dhaliwal, Huma Alam, Ron Briggs

Objective: To create an ETL based on raw NOAA hurricane data from the North Atlantic Basin and from that, create a series of visualizations that can help us gain insights into hurricanes, using graphs and maps.

What’s our story?
Climate Change has been a growing concern to humanity in recent decades.  One of the consequences of climate change is an increased frequency of tropical storms.  We will create several visualizations that show the increase of tropical storms in the North American basin from 1950 to 2020.
